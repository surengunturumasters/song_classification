# Genre Classification
Predict the genre of songs using features from the million songs dataset

Some of these features include: 
  - similarity scores with other songs
  - artists
  - tags (descriptions)

Also attempted to preprocess data for sentiment analysis and user data as well

## Dataset 
Used last.fm dataset from the million songs website which includes information about the 
features described above. Also used tagtraum genre annotations for genre labels for each
track id.

## Result
Attempted to predict genre using a f1 metric in order to figure out whether song
genre types could be predicted without using lyrics.
